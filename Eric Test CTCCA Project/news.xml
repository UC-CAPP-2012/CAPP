<NewsHeading>Connoisseur of Canberra decay</NewsHeading>

<NewsBody>
Artist Trevor Dickinson was busy in a car park at Haig Park in Braddon yesterday doing a sketch of what will look to most of us, until as good an artist as him opens our eyes a little, a profoundly ugly thing.
The object of his affections yesterday was the old, decomposing, faded-yellow ''Mandalay'' bus that was once a popular late-night, take-away hot-food kitchen housed in a converted double-decker bus. It stood, emitting exotic smells and with its chains of lights twinkling in the darkness, where it is now, in Haig Park just across the road from where Lonsdale Street arrives at the park. Tens of thousands of today's Canberrans will remember patronising this eccentric eatery in its heyday.
Always attractively seedy, it is now for Dickinson, a connoisseur of such things, magnificently decaying. Yesterday he was crooning about it the way more traditional artists croon, in their misguided way, about the chocolate-box loveliness of Floriade.
''I'm trying to just highlight things that are in the street and that are around and that are interesting … and I love this. I love the way it looks now. I love the decay. And coming from London [he's been here 10 years and lives in Newcastle] the double-decker bus is a strong symbol with me. It's got a faded past. It's got the graffiti on it, which I think really adds to it now. I love the flat tyres. I love the colours on it [yes, there's lots of purple about it - there never was when it was a sober omnibus in use in suburban Sydney] and the fact that it's like this decayed old dinosaur sitting there. There's something dignified about it now. It's almost like a piece of street art. It should [laughing, but meaning it] be heritage-listed.''

Dickinson comes to Canberra (where greeting cards and teatowels of his idiosyncratic illustrations are on sale in boutiquey places like April's Caravan in Lyneham) and gets out and about (yesterday on a bicycle also deserving of heritage-listing) looking for odd Canberra things to sketch. One of his masterpieces (sorry if I gush but I love his work and think it important in representing the real Canberra to the world) is of the funny little pink caravan/souvenir shop that's sometimes up on top of Mount Ainslie. It sells deliciously tacky things. Dickinson remembers with delighted horror a koala fur tissue box which requires you to pull the tissues out of the koala's belly. It is probably illegal because Canberra's anal-retentive laws on such things (like the little red burger caravan at Kingston) try to stamp out the inelegant and the odd. Another kitsch object of his affections, lovingly portrayed, is Cockington Green's zany little publicity vehicle, a mock-Tudor mini with a thatched roof.
His best-selling image (on greeting cards) he reports is what's left of the Starlight drive-in entrance sign beside the highway at Watson. It's the perfect subject for him, he explains, because it's an unfashionable Canberra object that ''resonates'' with Canberra people as soon as they're reminded of it. Generations of us went there, driving past the welcoming sign, sometimes to canoodle, sometimes to indulge our tiny children, putting them into their pyjamas at home and arranging bedding for them in the back of the car, lifting the sleeping mites gently out of the car and carrying them to bed when we got home. Sigh.
Another fine work in the same genre as the Mandalay and the Starlight sign is his portrait of the (closed for the winter and due to re-open soon) diving platform at the Olympic Pool site in Civic. A million pairs of bare Canberran feet scampered up and down its slippery ladders (is there a reader who ever dared to go right up to the dizzying top, and jump?) during the pool's long outdoor history. Dickinson was quick to see what was in those days a utilitarian thing, a means to an end (jumping, screaming, into cool water on hot summer days) we never gave any thought to, is a really rather beautiful and substantial and effortlessly elegant work of public art. What ''resonances'' it has.
Dickinson doesn't make greeting cards out of everything and it's not certain the Mandalay will enjoy that treatment. One sketch in the big sketchbook he showed me yesterday is doomed to remain obscure because it's a big ''Trucks turning'' sign he saw at a Kingston building site across which someone has written the unfortunate sentiment ''F*** you''. We had a boyish laugh about it, and it is just the sort of warts-and-all Canberra artefact.
And yesterday morning, having captured the bus in his sketchbook, he set off on his heritage bicycle in search of other neglected Canberra subjects that either have warts or that (like Canberra's bus shelters he admires and like what he calls the ''Martian Embassy'' of the Shine Dome at the Academy of Science) have some character that needs a little teasing out and celebrating.
Online at Trevor Dickinson dot com (written like that) you'll find quite a gallery of Canberra according to this roving Novocastrian.

<NewsHeading>Trauma doctors plead for drivers to slow down</NewsHeading>
<NewsDateTime>04/10/2012</NewsDateTime>

Doctors who deal with the consequences of serious car accidents every day have pleaded with Canberrans to slow down on the roads as police launch a month-long anti-speeding blitz.
There have been seven deaths on ACT roads since April after the territory recorded 12 months without any road fatalities.
ACT Policing will target speeding motorists throughout October as a part of a road safety strategy.
At a joint press conference with police, Canberra Hospital trauma surgeon Frank Piscioneri said the faster a vehicle was travelling when an accident occurred, the more likely occupants would be seriously injured.

''Accidents … from what we've seen, are preventable if people take care and drive defensively,'' he said.
''Certainly speeding is a major cause of the amount of disability. Once you have the accident, the speed is the major determinant of the severity of the injury.
''The injuries from car accidents are often very severe because of the amount of force involved and affect multiple parts of the body and body systems.
''So many people are affected long term from the injuries and the injuries can be physical and emotional.''
Dr Piscioneri said hospital staff never got used to treating seriously injured patients.
''Even when there's a child on a table I look at that child and think this could be my own child and I think of the consequences of that. But you still have to do your best for them,'' he said.
Dr Piscioneri said road trauma cases sucked up resources at the hospital, with each seriously injured patient requiring the attention of several staff in the emergency department before being transferred to theatre where they would also require treatment from several clinicians.
Emergency physician and ANU medical school academic Drew Richardson said it had been upsetting for hospital staff to see several road accident fatalities this year.
''It's upsetting to the staff and upsetting as a statistician to realise that the causes are so well defined and not acted upon,'' Professor Richardson said.
ACT Policing acting traffic operations chief Sergeant Alison Williams said drivers who exceeded the speed limit put their own lives and those of others at risk.
''Over the recent long weekend, ACT Policing detected people in separate incidents travelling over 30km/h over the speed limit. That's a major issue for us,'' Sergeant Williams said.

<NewsHeading>Practice makes perfect: this family doctor one for the ages
</NewsHeading>
<NewsDateTime>04/10/2012</NewsDateTime>
<NewsBody>
In an age where everyone is an instant ''friend'' and relationships can be made or broken in 140 characters or less, the bond between Rod MacIver and the Ryan family is something to be treasured.
Four generations of the Ryan family continue to be treated by Dr MacIver who has had a presence in Canberra since 1976 when he arrived to work briefly at the then Woden Valley Hospital. He'd come from his homeland of Scotland via Sydney and left Canberra to work in Hobart, only to return soon after. And this time, for good.
''I originally came here for a two-year working holiday,'' he laughed.
The relationship between the family and the doctor stretches over more than 30 years.
Shirley Ryan, now 81, of O'Connor, has been a patient of Dr MacIver's since he joined a practice at the O'Connor shops in 1978.
Her son Stephen Ryan, 58, of Ainslie, became a Dr MacIver patient as well. So too his son Kai Ryan, 35, of Kaleen, and Kai's children Charlotte, 9, Amelia, 6, Jillian, 2, and Sebastian, five months.
When Dr MacIver left O'Connor after 31 years to join the North Canberra Family Practice in Belconnen in 2009, the family followed. Stephen Ryan said it wasn't a hard decision. ''He was the doctor we all felt comfortable with,'' he said.
Mrs Ryan, who with husband Greg, still lives in the same O'Connor house they moved into as newlyweds in 1954, says Dr MacIver was a friend.
''When you get along with someone, you feel comfortable with them and feel like they are really listening when you're telling them your tales of woe,'' Mrs Ryan said.
Kai's wife Jeanette, also a patient, said the family had always been impressed with the quality of his care: ''He's just very good at his job.''
Dr MacIver said caring for generations of families came with the territory and made his job that much more enjoyable, despite the politics, long hours and red tape that also went with being a GP.
''I guess it goes to the essence of being a general practitioner, this continuity of care. You really do care for patients from newborns to those at the end of their life. It's very rewarding,'' he said.
''Obviously a diagnosis is important but I think the holistic approach to patient care is so important.''
Dr MacIver said he felt ''very privileged'' to be part of the Ryan family's lives.
''When we moved from O'Connor to Belconnen, I was interested to see how many people would follow me,'' he said. ''I guess over the years people put their trust in you. I've always believed you treat people as you would like to be treated.''
And he's not going anywhere. ''People keep asking me if I'm going to retire. It must be the grey hair. But I have no plans to retire, it's too enjoyable,'' Dr MacIver said.
